            <h2> About Me </h2>

            <p>
                First, welcome to my webpage! I am currently a graduate student at Auburn University
                pursuing an Master's degree in Data Science and Engineering. I previously graduated from Auburn with a Bachelor's 
                degree in Computer Science. I have a passion for data science and artificial intelligence and have completed
                various projects in the field. I am proficient in Java, Python, and SQL. The projects section below showcases some of the work I have done. When it comes
                to machine learning, I have experience in Scikit-learn and am currently exploring TensorFlow and PyTorch. I also have 
                some experience in web development, specifically with HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as frameworks like Flask and React.
            </p>

                <h3> K-Means Clustering Tool </h3>
                <p> Full-stack web application that utilizes the K-Means machine learning algorithm to segment
                    images based on dominant colors. The application allows users to upload an image, enter a desired 
                    value of K for the number of clusters, view and download the segmented image. The application relies on
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend while the backend is built using Python and Flask. The K-Means 
                    algorithm was built from scratch in Python using NumPy and OpenCV while Flask was used for building the API 
                    to connect with the frontend.

                <h3> Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Style Transformation </h3>
                <p> Developed a convolutional neural network model that can successfully 
                    apply the style of an image to the semantic style of another. The model 
                    was implemented in Python using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and a pretrained VGG-19 model.
                    This project was inspired by the research published by Gatys, et al. on the same topic. </p>

                <h3> Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing. </h3>
                <p> Performed emotional sentiment analysis on 400k text samples from Twitter. 
                    Performed various NLP techniques, such as tokenization, stop word removal, etc. 
                    Trained multiple Machine Learning models (including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
                    and Multilayer Perceptron) using Scikit-learn, and achieved an average accuracy of 87%. </p>
